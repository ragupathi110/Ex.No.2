 Defining Prompting in the Context of LLMs: Clearly define what a prompt entails
when interacting with large language models for summarization.

 Categorizing Prompting Techniques: Explore various categories of prompting
strategies:

o Basic/Direct Prompts: Simple instructions like "Summarize this text."

o Instruction-Based Prompts: Providing more specific instructions on the
desired length, focus, or style of the summary.

o Question-Based Prompts: Framing the summarization task as answering
specific questions about the text.

o Role-Playing Prompts: Instructing the model to adopt a specific persona
while summarizing.

o Few-Shot Prompts: Providing the model with a few examples of inputsummary pairs to guide its generation.

o Chain-of-Thought Prompting: Guiding the model through intermediate
reasoning steps to arrive at the final summary.

 Key Elements of Effective Prompts: Discuss the crucial components that contribute
to well-performing prompts, such as clarity, specificity, context provision, and
constraints.

 Prompt Engineering Considerations: Highlight the iterative process of designing
and refining prompts to achieve optimal results.

### Cross-Platform Challenges and Considerations in Text Summarization

 Platform Diversity: Detail the various types of platforms where text summarization
is employed, including:

o Web Applications: Summarizing articles, blog posts, and web content.

o Mobile Applications: Providing concise summaries for news feeds,
notifications, and in-app content.

o Social Media Platforms: Generating short summaries for posts, threads, and
trending topics (often with character limitations).

o Enterprise Systems: Summarizing reports, emails, and internal documents.

o Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Providing quick summaries of
conversations or documents.

 Data Format and Structure Variations: Discuss how different platforms present
text data (e.g., HTML, plain text, structured data with metadata) and how this can
impact summarization.

 Contextual Differences and User Expectations: Highlight how the context and user
expectations for a summary can vary significantly across platforms (e.g., a tweet
summary vs. a research paper abstract).

 Technical Constraints: Address platform-specific limitations such as character
limits, API restrictions, and processing power.

 Maintaining Consistency and Quality Across Platforms: Emphasize the challenges
of ensuring that summarization remains accurate, coherent, and relevant regardless of
the platform.

### Evaluating Prompting Techniques Across Diverse Platforms

 Experimental Setup (Hypothetical or Actual): Describe a potential experimental
setup to evaluate different prompting techniques across various platforms. This could
involve:
